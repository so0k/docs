      "prose": "Terraform Video Programming language TypeScript Python Go C# Java The Cloud Development Kit for Terraform (CDKTF) generates JSON Terraform configuration from code in C#, Python, TypeScript, Java, or Go, and creates infrastructure using Terraform. With CDKTF, you can use hundreds of providers and thousands of module definitions provided by HashiCorp and the Terraform community. By using your programming language of choice, you can take advantage of the features and development workflows you are familiar with. CDKTF uses the Cloud Development Kit from AWS, which provides a set of language-native frameworks for defining infrastructure, and adapters that let underlying provisioning tools use those definitions. CDK for Terraform generates Terraform configuration to provision infrastructure with Terraform. The adapter works with existing Terraform providers and modules, and integrates with HCP Terraform and Terraform Enterprise. CDKTF uses the core Terraform workflow, including planning and applying your infrastructure changes. Follow this tutorial to install CDKTF and try a quick start example that provisions a Docker container. Prerequisites In order to use CDKTF, you need: The Terraform CLI (1.2+). Node.js and npm v16+. To follow the quickstart, you also need: Docker a recent version of the programming language prefer. Select a tab below to follow this tutorial with the version of your preferred language that we have tested. TypeScript v4.4 and Node.js v16.13 Install CDKTF You can install CDKTF with npm on most operating systems. You can also install CDKTF with Homebrew on MacOS. To install the most recent stable release of CDKTF, use npm install with the @latest tag. npm install --global cdktf-cli@latest Verify the installation Verify that you have CDKTF installed by running the cdktf help command to show the available subcommands. cdktf help cdktf Commands: cdktf init                Create a new cdktf project from a template. cdktf get                 Generate CDK Constructs for Terraform providers and modules. cdktf convert             Converts a single file of HCL configuration to CDK for Terraform. Takes the file to be converted on stdin. cdktf deploy [stacks...]  Deploy the given stacks             [aliases: apply] cdktf destroy [stacks..]  Destroy the given stacks cdktf diff [stack]        Perform a diff (terraform plan) for the given stack [aliases: plan] cdktf list                List stacks in app. cdktf login               Retrieves an API token to connect to Terraform Cloud or Terraform Enterprise. cdktf synth               Synthesizes Terraform code for the given app in a directory.

Start Docker Desktop if it is not already running. Create and initialize the project Start by creating a directory named learn-cdktf-docker for the project. mkdir learn-cdktf-docker Then, navigate into it. cd learn-cdktf-docker Inside the directory, initialize CDKTF with the appropriate template for your chosen language. Also specify that your project will use the Docker provider, and include the --local flag to prevent CDKTF from using HCP Terraform CDKTF will prompt you for information about your project, such as the name and description. Accept the defaults for these options. cdktf init --template=typescript --providers=kreuzwerker/docker --local Note: By supplying '--local' option you have chosen local storage mode for storing the state of your stack. This means that your Terraform state file will be stored locally on disk in a file 'terraform.<STACK NAME>.tfstate' in the root of your project. ? Project Name learn-cdktf-docker ? Project Description A simple getting started project for cdktf. ? Do you want to start from an existing Terraform project? No ? Do you want to send crash reports to the CDKTF team?
