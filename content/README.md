**[Follow the full quickstart guide](https://starter.mintlify.com/quickstart)**

## Development

Install the [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mint) to preview your documentation changes locally. To install, use the following command:

```
pnpm i
```

Run the following command at the root.

```
pnpm dev
```

View your local preview at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Publishing changes

Install our GitHub app from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/github-app) to propagate changes from your repo to your deployment. Changes are deployed to production automatically after pushing to the default branch.

## Need help?

### Troubleshooting

- If your dev environment isn't running: Run `pnpm update` to ensure you have the most recent version of the CLI.
- If a page loads as a 404: Make sure you are running in a folder with a valid `docs.json`.
